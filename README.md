# Sammy Furr - SCHEME-79 Emulator
Emulator For Scheme 79 Chip, written in Racket

I worked alone on this project.  The microcode was provided in the
SCHEME-79 paper.  It has been modified slightly by me, and large
amounts of other code have been writen to create the emulator.

## Usage

To run the emulator, simply type

```bash
racket scheme-79.rkt
```

You may want to comment or uncomment the few tests at the bottom of
the program.

## Paper

The paper is included as a pdf in the ```paper``` folder.  I've also
included the LaTeX source file and BibTex file.

# Thank you!
